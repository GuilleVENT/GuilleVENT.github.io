Drive - a collaborative project between KORA and RODRIGO

Kora (19) is a Spanish independent artist from Barcelona who has been gaining recognition in the National scene lately. She has been releasing music on her BandCamp since she was 14 years-old. Alone on her computer, Kora produces catchy songs with groovy baselines, vibing saxos and she complements it all with a unique voice. 

Rodrigo (22) is a Producer/Artist based in Miami, Florida who is currently working on an independent project that spans various genres. Rodrigo Iglesias comes from a family of musicians (Julio Iglesias and Enrique Iglesias), and this is Rodrigo's independent debut in the music industry. He initially wrote "Drive" inspired by the sounds of dream pop and early 80's new wave among other genres. In January, Rodrigo reached out to Kora to ask if she was interested in doing a collaboration. The song was subsequently recorded this spring between Málaga (Spain) and Miami.

- Rodrigo about Kora: 
"Her soft and velvety voice along side her vocal arrangement skills were the final touches "Drive" needed to take the song to its full potential."

- To what bands does "Drive" sound like? 
"To our ears it sounds like a blend of Phoebe Bridges, Cementaries, and LCD Soundsystem, and we believe it has its own musical character."

Hi Troy, I'm a big fan of your show on KEXP and also of The Young Evils. I remember buying the ¨¨ record at Easy Street Records back in 2012 when I was visiting Seattle, loving Seattle music scene. Ever since that time I visited Seattle I knew that great music sounds on KEXP. On KEXP o 5 minute long song is played if it is good enough, I believe the song my friends Kora and Rodrigo have done is good enough.
